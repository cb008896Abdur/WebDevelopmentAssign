        <p class="p1"> All the tea comes from the same plant. From production, growing conditions, and geography, the variations between teas arise. The Camellia Sinensis plant is native to Asia, but is currently grown in tropical and subtropical regions around the world.
            Due to the subtle variations that occur even within a single tea garden and the drastic differences between tea from different regions and tea produced in different styles, the variety in tea is equivalent to any beverage. The range is at  is at the heart of luxury in tea and made especially unique by the fact that the variations on the eye, nose and tongue come from the leaves of one plant.

                        <p class="p2">For the discerning tea drinker, white tea, known in Sri Lanka as Silver Tips, is among the most rare and refined of teas. While much of the "White Tea" branded tea around the world is simply a combination of a nominal amount of white tea and green or black teas, real white tea retains a particular appearance with a silvery leaf, with a velvety texture and when brewed, produces a vivid, golden liquor.The real white tea is created from the Camellia Sinensis plant's handpicked buds. The picking is limited to the most experienced tea pickers because it requires gentleness in order to prevent damage to the cells within the bud and allow fermentation and thus bitterness within the bud to grow. White tea is unusual in being completely handmade, with the carefully picked buds hand-sorted under the guidance of the teamaker to ensure that only the undamaged buds are in the batch and then gently sorted.

                    Plucked, withered and rolled green tea. It is not oxidized and oxidation is stopped by adding heat during the rolling process. For green tea, the fresh leaves are either steamed or pan-fired (tossed in a thick, dry wok) to a temperature hot enough to stop the leaf from browning the enzymes. Much like, really, blanching vegetables. Simultaneously, curling with the fingers, the leaves are formed by pushing into the wok's sides. Then the leaves are rolled and swirled-innumerable types have been created, each with a different taste.

             <p class="p4">
                Oolong teas are partially oxidized or fermented, ranging from light "Springtime Oolong Teas" that have a gentle, floral and mild sweetness to heavier dark Oolongs that are woody, often earthy with heavy fruit and sometimes caramelised notes. Sometimes 3 leaves and a bud, withered, fermented, then heated, rolled and dried, the teas are picked.

             <p class="p5">
                Black tea, the most common type of tea from Sri Lanka, India, Kenya and other former British colonies, is completely fermented. To minimize moisture and make the leaf pliable, black tea is picked, withered, then rolled, fermented and dried (or red) before sifting.
