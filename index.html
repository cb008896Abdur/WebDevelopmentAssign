                  Ceylon tea refers to tea produced in the highlands of Sri Lanka — formerly known as Ceylon. Like other types of tea, it's made from the dried and processed leaves of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis. ... The tea's notes of citrus and full-bodied taste are due to the unique environmental conditions in which it's grown.

                              In 1824, the British brought a tea plant from China to Ceylon and it was cultivated for non-commercial purposes in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya. In 1839, further experimental planting of tea started with tea plants brought by the East India Company from Assam and Calcutta.

                            The Scotsman, James Taylor, introduced commercial tea cultivation in Sri Lanka. In 1852, he arrived in Sri Lanka and settled on the estate of Loolecondera in Kandy.

                              A need emerged to mediate and track the sales of tea as Ceylon tea gained popularity throughout the world. On 30 July, 1883, under the auspices of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the first public Colombo Auction was conducted at the premises of Somerville & Co. The Colombo Tea Auction is known as the world's oldest and biggest tea auction centre. The Association of Ceylon Tea Traders was founded in 1894.
                              In 1980 Sri Lanka became the official supplier of tea at the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympic Games, in 1982 at the 12th Commonwealth Games in Brisbane and again in 1987 at Expo 88 in Australia. In 1981, the import of teas for blending and re-exports was introduced and in 1982 to production and export of green tea commenced in Sri Lanka. CTC teas commenced in the country in 1983.In 1992 the 125th anniversary of the industry was celebrated in an international convention in Colombo. In 1992-1993 many of the government-owned tea estates became privatized again.

                              <li>Tea is good for you. Among other things, it contains “polyphenols”—antioxidants that repair cells and in doing so, may help our bodies fight help us fend off cardiovascular diseases, cancers, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus and other maladies. And contrary to popular belief, it’s not just green tea that’s good for you. Black, white, and red tea also have health-giving flavonoids and polyphenols.</li>
                              <li>Some tea grows in the United States. There is an island tea plantation off the coast of South Carolina and also in Hawaii.

                              <li>You are less likely to get a “caffeine crash” when you drink tea (as opposed to soda or coffee). Why? The high levels of antioxidants in tea slow the absorption of caffeine, which results in a gentler increase caffeine in your system and a longer period of alertness with no crash at the end.</li>
