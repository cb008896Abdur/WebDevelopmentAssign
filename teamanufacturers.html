                        <p>Sri Lankan family tea company Dilmah, founded by Merrill J. Fernando, today the world's most experienced teamaker, has championed quality, authenticity and variety in tea. Dilmah pioneered the concept of Single Origin Tea in 1988 when the family company went against industry trends to declare its commitment to authenticity. Garden fresh, unblended tea is a hallmark of Dilmah and offers a unique taste of unblended Ceylon Tea packed at source.

                            Dilmah Tea is Ethical Tea, in that all packaging profits are retained in Sri Lanka and fund the MJF Charitable Foundation and Dilmah Conservation. We believe that Business is a Matter of Human Service. </p>

                        <p>James Taylor arrived in Ceylon in 1852, settling down at the Loolecondera Estate, Galaha. He begins a 19-acre tea plantation on the Loolecondera Estate in 1867, laying the foundation for what would become Sri Lanka’s largest export industry for over a century.

                            In 1872, a fully equipped tea factory began operating on the Loolecondera Estate.
                            
                            In 1873, Ceylon Tea made its international debut when twenty-three pounds of tea produced by James Taylor reached London.</p>

                    <img src=images\akbar.jpg alt="Akbar tea"class="image3" width="100" height="100">
                    <p>For nearly as long as fine Ceylon tea has been cultivated on the Sri Lanka’s mountain slopes, the Akbarally family has been involved in its selection, blending, packaging and export. Today the firm still owned and managed by members of this family is Sri Lanka’s largest tea exporter, a position it has enjoyed unchallenged since 1992. Currently it exports about a fifth of the country’s annual production.
